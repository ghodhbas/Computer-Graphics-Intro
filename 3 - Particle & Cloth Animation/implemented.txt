-ODE Integrators: presseing 'e', 'r', 't' switches between the integrators
    Explicit Euler  
    RK4
    Trapezoidal
    
-switch between 3 different systems (1 particle, pendulum, cloth).
-reset ability - press x to reset animation
-abstraction between stepper and integrator:
    stepper uses integrator to calculate derivatives and then derives the next step data.
-Particel System. 

-customizable pendulum System (nb of particles and parameters)

-cloth simulation and animation (press a)
