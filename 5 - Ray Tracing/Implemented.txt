-Ray tracing: added reflection and refraction of light by generating new light rays and tracing them

-Shadows: generate rays toward light source and if they are blocked the light influence is not added

-Perlin Noise for marble looking Material

-Antialiasing using : jittering (supersampling and randomizing the ray)
                      Gaussian Blur
                      Down-Sampling
